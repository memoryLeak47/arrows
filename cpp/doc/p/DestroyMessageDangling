# p/DestroyMessageDangling

CausedBy: "c/DestroyMessage"

# Description
When an DestroyMessage is handled, you can't check for more messages because the entity is now a dangling pointer.
You also have dangling pointers when a message after this DestroyMessage has a pointer to the sending entity itself.

while (e->hasMessage()) {
	process(e->pollMessage()) // deletes e
}

There is a similar issue with DestroyMessage, that when iterating over the entities and polling them: some entities are skipped.
