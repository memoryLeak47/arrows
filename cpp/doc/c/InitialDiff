# Description
Splits Arrows in CoreSys, MenuSys, GameSys, NetworkSys and HelpSys

CoreSys:
	Starts the program, initialize Screen and calls the tick() and render() function regularly.

	Start the Program:
		Initialize Debug, Account, Screen, Team, GraphicsManager, MenuList, NetworkDevice.
	Initialize Screen:
		Create a new Window
	tick/render:
		The tick function and the render function should be called in a constant rate (by default 24 fps).
		If a tick takes longer than a 1/24 Second the wasted time should be catched up.

MenuSys:
	Allows to replace the currently shown Menu with a new one, handles render()ing and tick()ing.
	Provides functions for render()ing, tick()ing and Event-Handling.
	Provides Components to build Menues with.
GameSys:
	Renders and handles the main-Game
	Handles game-objects like Players, Mobs, Bullets, Idlers, Tiles, Cosmetics and their behaviour, health, effects, skills, rendering, networking and physics. Also the global game logic.

	Behaviour:
		Players:
			Players are controlled by a User.
			Players can move left/right and jump. Also they can use 4 skills.
		Mobs:
			Mobs can move like Players and some can use skills, but by default they are not controlled by a User.
		Bullets:
			They are game-objects, which are initially created by a Mob or Player.
		Idlers:
			Idlers are game-objects, which doesn't move without external impact.
		Tiles:
			Tiles are game-objects fixed on the Map and building the terrain.
		Cosmetics:
			Cosmetics are only decorative objects, which may only collide with tiles and therefore have no direct impact on the game.

	Physics:
		It depends on the game-objects, whether and how objects collide and react to the collision.

	Effects:
		An Effect is a property, which has been explicitly connected to a game object, mostly buffs and debuffs like "burning".

	Skills:
		Every player and some mobs have skills.

	Health:
		All Mobs and Players have a health bar, if the health decreases to zero, the particular unit dies.

	Death:
		If a Mob dies, it is just removed from the game.
		If a player dies, he respawns.

	GameLogic:
		We may add a campaign mode, but this section now describes only the PvP mode.

		There are n teams, who all play against each other.
		Every team has it's own counter.
		The first team, whichs counter has reached 100 has won.

		Every player can decide whether the experience he gets, is granted to the team counter, or used to empower the player itself.
		# TODO PARADOX, team none vs. counter

NetworkSys:
	Handles sending and receiving Packets.
	Provides functions for sending packets to a specific IP address and receiving & handling packets.

HelpSys:
	Provides general-purpose tools for simplifing implementations.
	The goal of this task depends on the current situation.
	Gives helpful functions for implementing stuff
