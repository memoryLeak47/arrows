ApproxDuration: ""
DependsOn: "c/MessageDispatcher"

# Description
Every Message-subclass has an own MessageType.
Every Listener has a 'bool MessageListener::listensTo(Message*)'-function. This function returns whether the message is listened by the listener or not.
A Listener can listen to more than one MessageType.

Frame contains a list of all known message-listeners.
A Listener can subscribe to all Message-Types he listens to, by adding himself in this list.
When it comes to Frame::applyMessage(Message*). All listeners in this lists are iterated and checked, if this listener is listen to this message.
If yes, than the Listener::applyMessage(Message*)-Function will be called.
