DependsOn: "c/GameTileMap"

# Description
All Entities, except for tiles, are stored in lists (std::vector).
The lists are players, idlers and mobs.
Tiles are stored in GameTileMap.

All these lists, except for the list of tiles in the GameTileMap, are stored in frames.
A frame represents a moment in the game.

the class FrameHistory contains a list of Frames, which happened after each other.

The "game" contains a `Frame mainFrame` and a `FrameHistory mainFrameHistory`.
Every Frame is cloneable, by using the Frame::clone() function, this also clones all objects inside the frame.
In "game"::tick() the "game" calls `mainFrame.tick()` and `mainFrameHistory.add(mainFrame.clone())` in a yet to be decided order.

MessageSystem:
	A MessageSystem provides a way for the entities to give information to each other and to the game.
