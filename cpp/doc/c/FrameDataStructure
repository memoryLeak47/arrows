# Description
class Frame;
class FrameHistory;

All Entities are stored in frames.
A frame represents a moment in the game.

the class FrameHistory contains a list of Frames, which happened after each other.

The "game" contains a `Frame mainFrame` and a `FrameHistory mainFrameHistory`.
A Frame is cloneable, by using the Frame::clone() function. This clones all stateful objects inside the frame, The stateless objects are preferably not cloned.
In "game"::tick() the "game" calls `mainFrame.tick()` and `mainFrameHistory.add(mainFrame.clone())` in a yet to be decided order.

MessageSystem:
	A MessageSystem provides a way for the entities to give information to each other and to the "game".
