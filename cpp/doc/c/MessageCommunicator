# Description
class MessageCommunicator : MessageListener {
	std::vector<Message*> messages
	Message* pollMessage()
	bool hasMessage()
}
Entity, Skill, Item, Effect : MessageCommunicator
Game : MessageListener

[c/Game: class Game; -- The superior modular unit]

The Game regularly polls the Messages of all Entities.
Every Entity polls Messages of its Skills, Items, Effects.

When a message is broadcasted, the Game broadcasts it to the entities,
which then broadcast them farther to their Skills, Items and Effects.

So the Game and {Skills, Items, Effects} do not communicate directly with each other.
