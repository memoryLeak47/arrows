# c/DetachDestruction

ApproxDuration: ""
DependsOn: "c/DynamicEntity"

# Description
enum DetachState { ALIVE, REMOVE_POINTERS, DELETE }

DynamicEntity {
	void detach()
	DetachState getDetachState() const
}

After the detach()-function is called, the corresponding entity has no more influence to the game.
the detach()-function changes the detach_state from ALIVE to REMOVE_POINTERS.
In the REMOVE_POINTERS-stage all the pointers to the entity should be removed within one frame.
In the DELETE-stage the entity will be finally `delete`d.
