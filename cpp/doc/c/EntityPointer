# Description
class EntityPointer { int id }
Game { Entity* getEntityById(int id) }

There is a randomly generated id for every Entity.
There should never be two Entities sharing the same id in one Game.

[c/Game: class Game; -- The superior modular unit]

This concept is useful in conjunction with c/FrameDataStructure: (Game := Frame)
	When an Entity is clone()d, the cloned Entity has the same id.
