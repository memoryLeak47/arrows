# c/EntityPointer

ApproxDuration: ""
DependsOn: "c/Entity"

# Description
class EntityPointer { int id }
Game { Entity* getEntityById(int id) }

There is a randomly generated id for every Entity.
There should never be two Entities sharing the same id in one Game.

This may be used to point to Tiles, which are not really Tile-instances for memory-overhead-reasons.

[c/Game: class Game; -- The superior modular unit]

This concept is useful in conjunction with c/FrameDataStructure: (Game := Frame)
	When an Entity is clone()d, the cloned Entity has the same id.
