ApproxDuration: ""
DependsOn: "c/Entity"

# Description
class EntityPointer { int id }
Frame { Entity* getEntityById(int id) }

There is a randomly generated id for every Entity.
When an Entity is clone()d, the cloned Entity has the same id.
There should never be two Entities sharing the same id in one Frame.
