ApproxDuration: "0"
DependsOn: "c/Effect, c/Avatar, c/Item"

# Description
Stats depend on items and effects and optionally the avatar itself.
There is no mana.

player_attack is (sum of item attacks) + (sum of effect attacks) + (avatar attack).
bullet_attack(player_attack) = m*player_attack + n, where m and n depend on the bullet.
The real damage dealt to a player is damage(bullet_attack, defense) = (bullet_attack*k)/(defense+k), where k is a global constant.

Stats which depend on the avatar:
- Movement speed
- Jump power
- attack
- defense
- tenacity (max health)

Stats which don't depend on the avatar:
- Cooldown reduction (= 0)
- Channeling reduction (= 0)
- life-Regeneration (= 0)

These are all stats.

All "living" objects including players have these stats.

All "not-living" objects, which can be destroyed just have tenacity (max health) and an implicit defense = 0.
