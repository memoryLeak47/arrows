# Description
Renders and handles the Game.

Handles game-objects like Players, Mobs, Bullets, Idlers, Tiles, Cosmetics and their behaviour, health, effects, skills, rendering, networking and physics. Also the global game logic.

Behaviour:
	Players:
		Players are controlled by a User.
		Players can move left/right and jump. Also they can use 4 skills.
	Mobs:
		Mobs can move like Players and some can use skills, but by default they are not controlled by a User.
	Bullets:
		They are game-objects, which are initially created by a Mob or Player.
	Idlers:
		Idlers are game-objects, which doesn't move without external impact.
	Tiles:
		Tiles are game-objects fixed on the Map and building the terrain.
	Cosmetics:
		Cosmetics are only decorative objects, which may only collide with tiles and therefore have no direct impact on the game.

Physics:
	It depends on the game-objects, whether and how objects collide and react to the collision.

Effects:
	An Effect is a property, which has been explicitly connected to a game object, mostly buffs and debuffs like "burning".

Skills:
	Every player and some mobs have skills.

Health:
	All Mobs and Players have a health bar, if the health decreases to zero, the particular unit dies.
